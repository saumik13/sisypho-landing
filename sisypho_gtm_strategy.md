## Executive Summary

### Vision
To become the global leader in no-code automation, empowering every knowledge worker to eliminate repetitive tasks without technical expertise.

### Mission
Sisypho transforms how non-technical professionals work by providing an intuitive, AI-powered automation platform that learns from demonstration rather than programming, saving organizations millions of hours annually.

### Market Opportunity
The global automation market is experiencing unprecedented growth, with the RPA market alone projected to reach $13.74 billion by 2028 (CAGR 32.8%). However, 73% of knowledge workers still perform repetitive tasks manually due to the technical complexity of existing solutions. Sisypho addresses this massive underserved market of 1.25 billion knowledge workers globally who lack coding skills but desperately need automation.

### Strategic Approach
Sisypho employs a **Product-Led Growth (PLG)** strategy, similar to successful companies like Zapier and Notion, but with a critical differentiator: zero technical barrier to entry. Our "show once, automate forever" approach allows users to start automating within 5 minutes, without writing a single line of code or understanding APIs.

### Key Success Metrics (24-Month Targets)
- **Revenue**: $10M ARR by end of Year 2
- **Users**: 100,000 active users
- **Customer Acquisition**: CAC < $100, LTV:CAC ratio > 3:1
- **Product Metrics**: 70% activation rate, <5% monthly churn
- **Market Position**: Top 3 in no-code automation category

### Current Traction
- 2 active beta users with 15+ hours saved weekly
- 60+ waitlist signups (organic, no paid marketing)
- 70% beta pricing discount secured for early adopters
